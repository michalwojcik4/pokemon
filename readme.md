# Pokemon App

This is a simple React Native application that allows users to browse and search for Pokémon. It utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch data about Pokémon and display them in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Pokemon Details Screen: Shows detailed information about a specific Pokémon, including its name.

## Technologies Used

- React Native: The framework used for building the mobile application.
